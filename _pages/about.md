I'm a fouth year undergraduate student from [ESCP Business School](https://escp.eu/). My professional interests include finance, accounting, and investment. 

I had spent a happy year at [Tsinghua University](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/) during my freshman year. Recently, I have come to [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) for a semester exchange in my final year of undergraduate studies. I am currently seeking a long-term job in Beijing. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me at: buaa_syp@163.com.

During my undergraduate studies, I interned as an Investment Assistant at China Aerospace Hi-Tech Investment Company, and also worked as an investment intern at TAL Education Group and Shinefore Venture Capital, advised by Sophie Ling Teng.

I am fluent in four languages: Mandarin (native), English (fluent, IELTS 6.5), French (basic, CEFR B1), and German (basic). I also obtained the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) certificate in my freshman year.

My hobbies include scuba diving (Open Water Diver and Free Diver Level 2), skiing (member of the Tsinghua Ski Team), surfing, and skydiving. However, I have injured my back recently, so I temporarily cannot engage in these activitiesðŸ˜‚.
